"So far, it's been assumed that each URI has exactly one representation of"
" the target resource. By default, HTTP caching is done by using the URI "
"of the resource as the cache key. If two people request the same URI of a"
" cacheable resource, the second person will receive the cached version."

"Sometimes this isn't enough and different versions of the same URI need "
"to be cached based on one or more request header values. For instance, if"
" you compress pages when the client supports it, any given URI has two "
"representations: one when the client supports compression, and one when "
"it does not. This determination is done by the value of the ``Accept-"
"Encoding`` request header."

"In this case, you need the cache to store both a compressed and "
"uncompressed version of the response for the particular URI and return "
"them based on the request's ``Accept-Encoding`` value. This is done by "
"using the ``Vary`` response header, which is a comma-separated list of "
"different headers whose values trigger a different representation of the "
"requested resource:"
