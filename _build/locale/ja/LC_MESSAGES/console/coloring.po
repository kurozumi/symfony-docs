"By default, the Windows command console doesn't support output coloring. "
"The Console component disables output coloring for Windows systems, but "
"if your commands invoke other scripts which emit color sequences, they "
"will be wrongly displayed as raw escape characters. Install the `Cmder`_,"
" `ConEmu`_, `ANSICON`_, `Mintty`_ (used by default in GitBash and Cygwin)"
" or `Hyper`_ free applications to add coloring support to your Windows "
"command console."
