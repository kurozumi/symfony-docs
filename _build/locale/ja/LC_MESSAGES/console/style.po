msgid ""
"One of the most boring tasks when creating console commands is to deal "
"with the styling of the command's input and output. Displaying titles and"
" tables or asking questions to the user involves a lot of repetitive "
"code."

"Consider for example the code used to display the title of the following "
"command::"

#: ../../../console/style.rst:36

"Displaying a simple title requires three lines of code, to change the "
"font color, underline the contents and leave an additional blank line "
"after the title. Dealing with styles is required for well-designed "
"commands, but it complicates their code unnecessarily."

"In order to reduce that boilerplate code, Symfony commands can optionally"
" use the **Symfony Style Guide**. These styles are implemented as a set "
"of helper methods which allow to create *semantic* commands and forget "
"about their styling."
