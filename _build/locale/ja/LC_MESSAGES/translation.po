"The term \"internationalization\" (often abbreviated `i18n`_) refers to "

"text, this means wrapping each with a function capable of translating the"

"*language* code, an underscore (``_``), then the `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2`_ "

"When this code is executed, Symfony will attempt to translate the message"

"collection of translations for a given locale. This \"dictionary\" of "

msgid ""
"This example illustrates the two different philosophies when creating "
"messages to be translated::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:182
msgid ""
"In the first method, messages are written in the language of the default "
"locale (English in this case). That message is then used as the \"id\" "
"when creating translations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:186
msgid ""
"In the second method, messages are actually \"keywords\" that convey the "
"idea of the message. The keyword message is then used as the \"id\" for "
"any translations. In this case, translations must be made for the default"
" locale (i.e. to translate ``symfony.great`` to ``Symfony is great``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:191
msgid ""
"The second method is handy because the message key won't need to be "
"changed in every translation file if you decide that the message should "
"actually read \"Symfony is really great\" in the default locale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:195
msgid ""
"The choice of which method to use is entirely up to you, but the "
"\"keyword\" format is often recommended for multi-language applications, "
"whereas for shared bundles that contain translation resources we "
"recommend the real message, so your application can choose to disable the"
" translator layer and you will see a readable message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:201
msgid ""
"Additionally, the ``php`` and ``yaml`` file formats support nested ids to"

msgid ""
"The ``locale`` of the current user, which is stored on the request is "
"determined;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:251
msgid ""
"A catalog (e.g. big collection) of translated messages is loaded from "
"translation resources defined for the ``locale`` (e.g. ``fr_FR``). "
"Messages from the :ref:`fallback locale <translation-fallback>` are also "
"loaded and added to the catalog if they don't already exist. The end "
"result is a large \"dictionary\" of translations. This catalog is cached "
"in production to minimize performance impact."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation.rst:258

" not, the translator returns the original message."

"However, creating a translation for this string is impossible since the "

"portions (e.g. *\"Hello Ryan\"* or *\"Hello Fabien\"*)."
