#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:81
msgid ""
"When a feature implementation cannot be replaced with a better one "
"without breaking backward compatibility, Symfony deprecates the old "

"to learn more about how deprecations are handled in Symfony."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:89
msgid ""
"This deprecation policy also requires a custom development process for "
"major versions (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, etc.) In those cases, Symfony develops at "
"the same time two versions: the new major one (e.g. 4.0) and the latest "
"version of the previous branch (e.g. 3.4)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:94
msgid ""
"Both versions have the same new features, but they differ in the "
"deprecated features. The oldest version (3.4 in this example) contains "
"all the deprecated features whereas the new version (4.0 in this example)"
" removes all of them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:98
msgid ""
"This allows you to upgrade your projects to the latest minor version "
"(e.g. 3.4), see all the deprecation messages and fix them. Once you have "
"fixed all those deprecations, you can upgrade to the new major version "
"(e.g. 4.0) without effort, because it contains the same features (the "
"only difference are the deprecated features, which your project no longer"
" uses)."

"This release process was adopted to give more *predictability* and "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shorten the release cycle (allow developers to benefit from the new "
"features faster);"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:112
msgid ""
"Give more visibility to the developers using the framework and Open-"
"Source projects using Symfony;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:114
msgid ""
"Improve the experience of Symfony core contributors: everyone knows when "
"a feature might be available in Symfony;"

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:116
msgid ""
"Coordinate the Symfony timeline with popular PHP projects that work well "
"with Symfony and with projects using Symfony;"

"The six month period was chosen as two releases fit in a year. It also "
"allows for plenty of time to work on new features and it allows for non-"
"ready features to be postponed to the next version without having to wait"
" too long for the next cycle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../contributing/community/releases.rst:128
msgid ""
"The dual maintenance mode was adopted to make every Symfony user happy. "
"Fast movers, who want to work with the latest and the greatest, use the "
"standard version: a new version is published every six months, and there "
"is a two months period to upgrade. Companies wanting more stability use "
"the LTS versions: a new version is published every two years and there is"
" a year to upgrade."
