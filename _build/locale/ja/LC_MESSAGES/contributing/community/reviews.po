"Symfony is an open-source project driven by a large community. If you "
"don't feel ready to contribute code or patches, reviewing issues and pull"
" requests (PRs) can be a great start to get involved and give back. In "
"fact, people who \"triage\" issues are the backbone to Symfony's success!"

#: ../../../contributing/community/reviews.rst:19

"Community reviews are essential for the development of the Symfony "

"**Bug Reports**: Bug reports need to be checked for completeness. Is any "
"important information missing? Can the bug be reproduced?"

"**Pull Requests**: Pull requests contain code that fixes a bug or "
"implements new functionality. Reviews of pull requests ensure that they "
"are implemented properly, are covered by test cases, don't introduce new "
"bugs and maintain backward compatibility."
