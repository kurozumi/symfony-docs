"The Symfony community benefits greatly when as many people as possible "
"share their knowledge and experience with others. Every different point "
"of view adds to our collective understanding of how to best use and "
"evolve the code, design patterns and architecture provided within the "
"Symfony community. Because of this, we specifically want to hear from "
"long-time contributors and new users, who often come across entirely "
"different challenges with a totally fresh new look and perspective."

"Giving a first talk at a conference can seem quite intimidating. But "
"don't worry! At one time, every speaker went through the same process. "
"And so, we want to make sure that as many people as possible are "
"empowered to take this path if they are motivated. We have collected a "
"few resources with advice to get started. More importantly, we can "
"connect experienced speakers with people who are just taking their first "
"steps in this area:"

"A good first step might be to give a talk at a local user group to a "
"smaller crowd that one knows more intimately. A next step could be to "
"give a talk at conference in your first language."

"The best way to find people that can review your talk idea or slides is "
"the `#speaker-mentoring`_ channel on `Symfony Slack`_. There are many "
"seasoned speakers with knowledge in various parts of Symfony that are "
"motivated to help you get started on your path towards becoming a public "
"speaker. They can even do practice runs via video chat! Furthermore, they"
" can also be an ally when it comes to the day of giving the talk at a "
"conference!"

"A great resource with advice on everything related to `public speaking`_ "
"is a collection of links maintained by VM (Vicky) Brasseur. It covers "
"everything from finding a conference call for proposals, how to refine a "
"proposal, to how to put together slide decks to practical tips for "
"preparation and talk delivery."
