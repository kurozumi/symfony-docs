"The main Symfony code repository receives thousands of issues reports per"
" year. Some of those issues are easy to understand and the Symfony Core "
"developers can fix them without any other information. However, other "
"issues are much harder to understand because developers can't reproduce "
"them in their computers. That's when we'll ask you to create a \"bug "
"reproducer\", which is the minimum amount of code needed to make the bug "
"appear when executed."
