"But sometimes, a new feature is controversial or you cannot find a "
"convincing API. In such cases, we prefer to gather feedback from real-"
"world usage, adapt the API, or remove it altogether. Doing so is not "
"possible with a no BC-break approach."

"To avoid being bound to our backward compatibility promise, such features"
" can be marked as **experimental** and their classes and methods must be "
"marked with the ``@experimental`` tag."

"A feature can be marked as being experimental for only one minor version,"
" and can never be introduced in an :ref:`LTS version <releases-lts>`. The"
" core team can decide to extend the experimental period for another minor"
" version on a case by case basis."
