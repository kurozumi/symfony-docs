"Symfony applications have the following default directory structure, but "
"you can override it to create your own structure:"

"The configuration directory is the only one which cannot be overridden in"
" a Symfony application. Its location is hardcoded as the ``config/`` "

"In this code, ``$this->environment`` is the current environment (i.e. "
"``dev``). In this case you have changed the location of the cache "
"directory to ``var/{environment}/cache/``."

#: ../../../configuration/override_dir_structure.rst:66
msgid ""
"You should keep the cache directory different for each environment, "
"otherwise some unexpected behavior may happen. Each environment generates"
" its own cached configuration files, and so each needs its own directory "
"to store those cache files."

"Overriding the ``var/log/`` directory is the same as overriding the "
"``var/cache/`` directory. The only difference is that you need to "
"override the ``getLogDir()`` method::"
