msgid ""
"In November 2018, several changes were made to the core Symfony *recipes*"
" related to the ``.env`` file. These changes make working with "
"environment variables easier and more consistent - especially when "
"writing functional tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:8
msgid ""
"If your app was started before November 2018, your app **does not require"
" any changes to keep working**. However, if/when you are ready to take "
"advantage of these improvements, you will need to make a few small "
"updates."

msgid "What Changed Exactly?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But first, what changed? On a high-level, not much. Here's a summary of "
"the most important changes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:18
msgid ""
"A) The ``.env.dist`` file no longer exists. Its contents should be moved "
"to your ``.env`` file (see the next point)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:21
msgid ""
"B) The ``.env`` file **is** now committed to your repository. It was "
"previously ignored via the ``.gitignore`` file (the updated recipe does "
"not ignore this file). Because this file is committed, it should contain "
"non-sensitive, default values. Basically, the ``.env.dist`` file was "
"moved to ``.env``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:26
msgid ""
"C) A ``.env.local`` file can now be created to *override* values in "
"``.env`` for your machine. This file is ignored in the new "
"``.gitignore``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:29
msgid ""
"D) When testing, your ``.env`` file is now read, making it consistent "
"with all other environments. You can also create a ``.env.test`` file for"
" test-environment overrides."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:33
msgid ""
"E) `One further change to the recipe in January 2019`_ means that your "
"``.env`` files are *always* loaded, even if you set an ``APP_ENV=prod`` "
"environment variable. The purpose is for the ``.env`` files to define "
"default values that you can override if you want to with real environment"
" values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:38
msgid ""
"There are a few other improvements, but these are the most important. To "
"take advantage of these, you *will* need to modify a few files in your "
"existing app."
msgstr ""

msgid "Updating My Application"

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:44
msgid ""
"If you created your application after November 15th 2018, you don't need "
"to make any changes! Otherwise, here is the list of changes you'll need "
"to make - these changes can be made to any Symfony 3.4 or higher app:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:48
msgid ""
"Create a new `config/bootstrap.php`_ file in your project. This file "
"loads Composer's autoloader and loads all the ``.env`` files as needed "
"(note: in an earlier recipe, this file was called ``src/.bootstrap.php``;"
" if you are upgrading from Symfony 3.3 or 4.1, use the "
"`3.3/config/bootstrap.php`_ file instead)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:53
msgid ""
"Update your `public/index.php`_ (`index.php diff`_) file to load the new "
"``config/bootstrap.php`` file. If you've customized this file, make sure "
"to keep those changes (but use the rest of the changes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../configuration/dot-env-changes.rst:57
msgid ""
"Update your `bin/console`_ file to load the new ``config/bootstrap.php`` "
"file."

"You can also update the `comment on the top of .env`_ to reflect the new "
"changes."

"If you're using PHPUnit, you will also need to `create a new .env.test`_ "
"file and update your `phpunit.xml.dist file`_ so it loads the "
"``config/bootstrap.php`` file."
