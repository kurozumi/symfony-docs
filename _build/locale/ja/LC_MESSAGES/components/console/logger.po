"The Console component comes with a standalone logger complying with the "
"`PSR-3`_ standard. Depending on the verbosity setting, log messages will "
"be sent to the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Console\\\\Output\\\\OutputInterface` "
"instance passed as a parameter to the constructor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../components/console/logger.rst:12
msgid ""
"The logger does not have any external dependency except ``psr/log``. This"
" is useful for console applications and commands needing a lightweight "
"PSR-3 compliant logger::"

msgid "You can rely on the logger to use this dependency inside a command::"

#: ../../../components/console/logger.rst:67
msgid ""
"The dependency will use the instance of "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Console\\\\Logger\\\\ConsoleLogger` as "
"logger. Log messages emitted will be displayed on the console output."

"By default, the console logger behaves like the :doc:`Monolog's Console "
"Handler </logging/monolog_console>`. The association between the log "
"level and the verbosity can be configured through the second parameter of"

#: ../../../components/console/logger.rst:112
msgid ""
"The Console logger includes a ``hasErrored()`` method which returns "
"``true`` as soon as any error message has been logged during the "
"execution of the command. This is useful to decide which status code to "
"return as the result of executing the command."
