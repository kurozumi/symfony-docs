"This adapter offers improved application performance for those who cannot"
" install tools like :ref:`APCu <apcu-adapter>` or :ref:`Redis <redis-"
"adapter>` in their environment. It stores the cache item expiration and "
"content as regular files in a collection of directories on a locally "
"mounted filesystem."

"The performance of this adapter can be greatly increased by utilizing a "
"temporary, in-memory filesystem, such as `tmpfs`_ on Linux, or one of the"
" many other `RAM disk solutions`_ available."

"The overhead of filesystem IO often makes this adapter one of the "
"*slower* choices. If throughput is paramount, the in-memory adapters "
"(:ref:`Apcu <apcu-adapter>`, :ref:`Memcached <memcached-adapter>`, and "
":ref:`Redis <redis-adapter>`) or the database adapters (:ref:`Doctrine "
"<doctrine-adapter>` and :ref:`PDO <pdo-doctrine-adapter>`) are "
"recommended."

"Since Symfony 3.4, this adapter implements "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Cache\\\\PruneableInterface`, enabling "
"manual :ref:`pruning of expired cache items <component-cache-cache-pool-"
