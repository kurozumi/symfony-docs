"Similarly to :ref:`Filesystem Adapter <component-cache-filesystem-"
"adapter>`, this cache implementation writes cache entries out to disk, "
"but unlike the Filesystem cache adapter, the PHP Files cache adapter "
"writes and reads back these cache files *as native PHP code*. For "
"example, caching the value ``['my', 'cached', 'array']`` will write out a"
" cache file similar to the following::"

"This adapter requires turning on the ``opcache.enable`` php.ini setting. "

"be much faster than other filesystem-based caches."

"While it supports updates and because it is using OPcache as a backend, "
"this adapter is better suited for append-mostly needs. Using it in other "
"scenarios might lead to periodical reset of the OPcache memory, "
"potentially leading to degraded performance."
