"In some scenarios such as code generation and code introspection, it's "
"usually required to convert words from/to singular/plural. For example, "
"if you need to know which property is associated with an *adder* method, "
"you must convert from plural to singular (``addStories()`` method -> "
"``$story`` property)."

"Although most human languages define simple pluralization rules, they "
"also define lots of exceptions. For example, the general rule in English "
"is to add an ``s`` at the end of the word (``book`` -> ``books``) but "
"there are lots of exceptions even for common words (``woman`` -> "
"``women``, ``life`` -> ``lives``, ``news`` -> ``news``, ``radius`` -> "
"``radii``, etc.)"

"This component abstracts all those pluralization rules so you can convert"
" from/to singular/plural with confidence. However, due to the complexity "
"of the human languages, this component only provides support for the "
"English language."
