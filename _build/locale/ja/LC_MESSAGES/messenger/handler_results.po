"When a message is handled, the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Middleware\\\\HandleMessageMiddleware`"
" adds a "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\HandledStamp` for "
"each object that handled the message. You can use this to get the value "

"The Messenger component can be used in CQRS architectures where command &"
" query buses are central pieces of the application. Read Martin Fowler's "
"`article about CQRS`_ to learn more and :doc:`how to configure multiple "
"buses </messenger/multiple_buses>`."

"As queries are usually synchronous and expected to be handled once, "
"getting the result from the handler is a common need."

"A :class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\HandleTrait` exists to get"
" the result of the handler when processing synchronously. It also ensures"
" that exactly one handler is registered. The ``HandleTrait`` can be used "
"in any class that has a ``$messageBus`` property::"

"Hence, you can use the trait to create command & query bus classes. For "
"example, you could create a special ``QueryBus`` class and inject it "
"wherever you need a query bus behavior instead of the "
"``MessageBusInterface``::"
