"Read :doc:`/logging/monolog_exclude_http_codes` to learn about a similar "
"but more generic feature that allows to exclude logs for any HTTP status "
"code and not only 404 errors."

"Sometimes your logs become flooded with unwanted 404 HTTP errors, for "
"example, when an attacker scans your app for some well-known application "
"paths (e.g. `/phpmyadmin`). When using a ``fingers_crossed`` handler, you"
" can exclude logging these 404 errors based on a regular expression in "
"the MonologBundle configuration:"

"Combining ``excluded_404s`` with a ``passthru_level`` lower than "
"``error`` (i.e. ``debug``, ``info``, ``notice`` or ``warning``) will not "
"actually exclude log messages for the URL(s) listed in ``excluded_404s`` "
"because they are logged with level of ``error`` or higher and "
"``passthru_level`` takes precedence over the URLs being listed in "
"``excluded_404s``."
