"Combining ``excluded_http_codes`` with a ``passthru_level`` lower than "
"``error`` (i.e. ``debug``, ``info``, ``notice`` or ``warning``) will not "
"actually exclude log messages for those HTTP codes because they are "
"logged with level of ``error`` or higher and ``passthru_level`` takes "
"precedence over the HTTP codes being listed in ``excluded_http_codes``."
