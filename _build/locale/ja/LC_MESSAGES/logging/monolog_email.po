"`Monolog`_ can be configured to send an email when an error occurs within"
" an application. The configuration for this requires a few nested "
"handlers in order to avoid receiving too many emails. This configuration "
"looks complicated at first but each handler is fairly straightforward "
"when it is broken down."

msgid ""
"The ``main`` handler is a ``fingers_crossed`` handler which means that it"
" is only triggered when the action level, in this case ``critical`` is "
"reached. The ``critical`` level is only triggered for 5xx HTTP code "
"errors. If this level is reached once, the ``fingers_crossed`` handler "
"will log all messages regardless of their level. The ``handler`` setting "
"means that the output is then passed onto the ``deduplicated`` handler."

"If you want both 400 level and 500 level errors to trigger an email, set "
"the ``action_level`` to ``error`` instead of ``critical``. See the code "
"above for an example."

"The ``deduplicated`` handler keeps all the messages for a request and "
"then passes them onto the nested handler in one go, but only if the "
"records are unique over a given period of time (60 seconds by default). "
"If the records are duplicates they are discarded. Adding this handler "
"reduces the amount of notifications to a manageable level, specially in "
"critical failure scenarios. You can adjust the time period using the "
"``time`` option:"

"The messages are then passed to the ``swift`` handler. This is the "
"handler that actually deals with emailing you the error. The settings for"
" this are straightforward, the to and from addresses, the formatter, the "
"content type and the subject."

"You can combine these handlers with other handlers so that the errors "
"still get logged on the server as well as the emails being sent:"

#: ../../../logging/monolog_email.rst:322
msgid ""
"This uses the ``group`` handler to send the messages to the two group "
"members, the ``deduplicated`` and the ``stream`` handlers. The messages "
"will now be both written to the log file and emailed."
