"It is possible to use the console to print messages for certain "
":doc:`verbosity levels </console/verbosity>` using the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Console\\\\Output\\\\OutputInterface` "
"instance that is passed when a command gets executed."

"When a lot of logging has to happen, it's cumbersome to print information"
" depending on the verbosity settings (``-v``, ``-vv``, ``-vvv``) because "
"the calls need to be wrapped in conditions. For example::"

"Instead of using these semantic methods to test for each of the verbosity"
" levels, the `MonologBridge`_ provides a "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Bridge\\\\Monolog\\\\Handler\\\\ConsoleHandler` that "
"listens to console events and writes log messages to the console output "
"depending on the current log level and the console verbosity."

"Depending on the verbosity level that the command is run in and the "
"user's configuration (see below), these messages may or may not be "
"displayed to the console. If they are displayed, they are timestamped and"
" colored appropriately. Additionally, error logs are written to the error"
" output (``php://stderr``). There is no need to conditionally handle the "
"verbosity settings anymore."

"Now, log messages will be shown on the console based on the log levels "
"and verbosity. By default (normal verbosity level), warnings and higher "
"will be shown. But in :doc:`full verbosity mode </console/verbosity>`, "
"all messages will be shown."
