"This article is about the Doctrine DBAL. Typically, you'll work with the "
"higher level Doctrine ORM layer, which uses the DBAL behind the scenes to"

"The `Doctrine`_ Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL) is an abstraction layer"
" that sits on top of `PDO`_ and offers an intuitive and flexible API for "
"communicating with the most popular relational databases. The DBAL "
"library allows you to write queries independently of your ORM models, "
"e.g. for building reports or direct data manipulations."
