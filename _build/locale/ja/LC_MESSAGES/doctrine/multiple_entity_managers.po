"You can use multiple Doctrine entity managers or connections in a Symfony"
" application. This is necessary if you are using different databases or "
"even vendors with entirely different sets of entities. In other words, "
"one entity manager that connects to one database will handle some "
"entities while another entity manager that connects to another database "
"might handle the rest."

"Using multiple entity managers is not complicated to configure, but more "
"advanced and not usually required. Be sure you actually need multiple "
"entity managers before adding in this layer of complexity."

"Entities cannot define associations across different entity managers. If "
"you need that, there are `several alternatives`_ that require some custom"
" setup."

"The following configuration code shows how you can configure two entity "
"managers:"

"In this case, you've defined two entity managers and called them "
"``default`` and ``customer``. The ``default`` entity manager manages "
"entities in the ``src/Entity/Main`` directory, while the ``customer`` "
"entity manager manages entities in ``src/Entity/Customer``. You've also "
"defined two connections, one for each entity manager."

"When working with multiple connections and entity managers, you should be"
" explicit about which configuration you want. If you *do* omit the name "
"of the connection or entity manager, the default (i.e. ``default``) is "
"used."

"If you use a different name than ``default`` for the default entity "
"manager, you will need to redefine the default entity manager in ``prod``"
