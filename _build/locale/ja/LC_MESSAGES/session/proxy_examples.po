"The session proxy mechanism has a variety of uses and this article "
"demonstrates two common uses. Rather than using the regular session "
"handler, you can create a custom save handler by defining a class that "
"extends the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Session\\\\Storage\\\\Proxy\\\\SessionHandlerProxy`"
" class."
