"Otherwise, if the problem is that you cannot avoid the application "

"If the legacy application requires its own session save handler, do not "
"override this. Instead set ``handler_id: ~``. Note that a save handler "
"cannot be changed once the session has been started. If the application "
"starts the session before Symfony is initialized, the save handler will "
"have already been set. In this case, you will need ``handler_id: ~``. "
"Only override the save handler if you are sure the legacy application can"
" use the Symfony save handler without side effects and that the session "
"has not been started before Symfony is initialized."
