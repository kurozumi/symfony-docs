"Twig allows to inject automatically one or more variables into all "
"templates. These global variables are defined in the ``twig.globals`` "
"option inside the main Twig configuration file:"

"Now, the variable ``ga_tracking`` is available in all Twig templates, so "
"you can use it without having to pass it explicitly from the controller "
"or service that renders the template:"

"In addition to static values, Twig global variables can also reference "
"services from the :doc:`service container </service_container>`. The main"
" drawback is that these services are not loaded lazily. In other words, "
"as soon as Twig is loaded, your service is instantiated, even if you "
"never use that global variable."

"To define a service as a global Twig variable, prefix the service ID "
"string with the ``@`` character, which is the usual syntax to :ref:`refer"
" to services in container parameters <service-container-parameters>`:"

"Now you can use the ``uuid`` variable in any Twig template to access to "
"the ``UuidGenerator`` service:"
