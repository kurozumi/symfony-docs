"The recommended way of :ref:`processing Symfony forms <processing-forms>`"
" is to use the "
":method:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Form\\\\FormInterface::handleRequest` "
"method to detect when the form has been submitted. However, you can also "

"method to have better control over when exactly your form is submitted "
"and what data is passed to it::"

"When submitting a form via a \"PATCH\" request, you may want to update "
"only a few submitted fields. To achieve this, you may pass an optional "
"second boolean argument to ``submit()``. Passing ``false`` will remove "
"any missing fields within the form object. Otherwise, the missing fields "
"will be set to ``null``."

"When the second parameter ``$clearMissing`` is ``false``, like with the "
"\"PATCH\" method, the validation will only apply to the submitted fields."
" If you need to validate all the underlying data, add the required fields"
" manually so that they are validated::"
