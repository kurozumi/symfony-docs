msgid ""
"The ``inherit_data`` form field option can be very useful when you have "
"some duplicated fields in different entities. For example, imagine you "
"have two entities, a ``Company`` and a ``Customer``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:41
msgid ""
"As you can see, each entity shares a few of the same fields: ``address``,"
" ``zipcode``, ``city``, ``country``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:44
msgid ""
"Start with building two forms for these entities, ``CompanyType`` and "
"``CustomerType``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:82
msgid ""
"Instead of including the duplicated fields ``address``, ``zipcode``, "
"``city`` and ``country`` in both of these forms, create a third form "
"called ``LocationType`` for that::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:114
msgid ""
"The location form has an interesting option set, namely ``inherit_data``."
" This option lets the form inherit its data from its parent form. If "
"embedded in the company form, the fields of the location form will access"
" the properties of the ``Company`` instance. If embedded in the customer "
"form, the fields will access the properties of the ``Customer`` instance "
"instead. Convenient, eh?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:122
msgid ""
"Instead of setting the ``inherit_data`` option inside ``LocationType``, "
"you can also (just like with any option) pass it in the third argument of"
" ``$builder->add()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:126
msgid ""
"Finally, make this work by adding the location form to your two original "
"forms::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:156
msgid ""
"That's it! You have extracted duplicated field definitions to a separate "
"location form that you can reuse wherever you need it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/inherit_data_option.rst:161
msgid ""
"Forms with the ``inherit_data`` option set cannot have ``*_SET_DATA`` "
"event listeners."
