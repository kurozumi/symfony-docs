"Symfony provides several ways of integrating Bootstrap into your "
"application. The most straightforward way is to add the required "
"``<link>`` and ``<script>`` elements in your templates (usually you only "
"include them in the main layout template which other templates extend "
"from):"

"If your application uses modern front-end practices, it's better to use "
":doc:`Webpack Encore </frontend>` and follow :doc:`this tutorial "
"</frontend/encore/bootstrap>` to import Bootstrap's sources into your "
"SCSS and JavaScript files."

"The next step is to configure the Symfony application to use Bootstrap 4 "
"styles when rendering forms. If you want to apply them to all forms, "
"define this configuration:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/bootstrap4.rst:66
msgid ""
"If you prefer to apply the Bootstrap styles on a form to form basis, "
"include the ``form_theme`` tag in the templates where those forms are "
"used:"

msgid "Accessibility"

msgid ""
"The Bootstrap 4 framework has done a good job making it accessible for "
"functional variations like impaired vision and cognitive ability. Symfony"
" has taken this one step further to make sure the form theme complies "
"with the `WCAG 2.0 standard`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/bootstrap4.rst:87
msgid ""
"This does not mean that your entire website automatically complies with "
"the full standard, but it does mean that you have come far in your work "
"to create a design for **all** users."

msgid ""
"Bootstrap 4 has a feature called \"`custom forms`_\". You can enable that"
" on your Symfony Form ``RadioType`` and ``CheckboxType`` by adding some "
"classes to the label:"

msgid ""
"When you use the Bootstrap form themes and render the fields manually, "
"calling ``form_label()`` for a checkbox/radio field doesn't render "
"anything. Due to Bootstrap internals, the label is already rendered by "
"``form_widget()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../form/bootstrap4.rst:114
msgid ""
"Form errors are rendered **inside** the ``<label>`` element to make sure "
"there is a strong connection between the error and its ``<input>``, as "
"required by the `WCAG 2.0 standard`_."
