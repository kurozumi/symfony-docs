"If you're creating a single page app (SPA), then you probably only need "
"to define *one* entry in ``webpack.config.js``. But if you have multiple "
"pages, you might want page-specific CSS and JavaScript."

"Typically, you should include only *one* JavaScript entry per page. Think"
" of the checkout page as its own \"app\", where ``checkout.js`` includes "
"all the functionality you need."

"However, it's pretty common to need to include some global JavaScript and"
" CSS on every page. For that reason, it usually makes sense to have one "
"entry (e.g. ``app``) that contains this global code (both JavaScript & "
"CSS) and is included on every page (i.e. it's included in the *layout* of"
" your app). This means that you will always have one, global entry on "
"every page (e.g. ``app``) and you *may* have one page-specific JavaScript"
" and CSS file from a page-specific entry (e.g. ``checkout``)."
