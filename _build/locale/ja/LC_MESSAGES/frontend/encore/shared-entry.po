"Suppose you have multiple entry files and *each* requires ``jquery``. In "
"this case, *each* output file will contain jQuery, slowing down your "
"user's experience. To solve this, you can *extract* the common libraries "
"to a \"shared\" entry file that's included on every page."

"Suppose you already have an entry called ``app`` that's included on every"
" page. Update your code to use ``createSharedEntry()``:"

"Before making this change, if both ``app.js`` and ``store.js`` require "
"``jquery``, then ``jquery`` would be packaged into *both* files, which is"
" wasteful. By making ``app.js`` your \"shared\" entry, *any* code "
"required by ``app.js`` (like jQuery) will *no longer* be packaged into "
"any other files. The same is true for any CSS."

"Because ``app.js`` contains all the common code that other entry files "
"depend on, its script (and link) tag must be on every page."

"The ``app.js`` file works best when its contents are changed *rarely* and"
" you're using :ref:`long-term caching <encore-long-term-caching>`. Why? "
"If ``app.js`` contains application code that *frequently* changes, then "
"(when using versioning), its filename hash will frequently change. This "
"means your users won't enjoy the benefits of long-term caching for this "
"file (which is generally quite large)."
