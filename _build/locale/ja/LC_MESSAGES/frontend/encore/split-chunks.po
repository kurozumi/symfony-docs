"Suppose you have multiple entry files and *each* requires ``jquery``. In "
"this case, *each* output file will contain jQuery, making your files much"
" larger than necessary. To solve this, you can ask webpack to analyze "
"your files and *split* them into additional files, which will contain "
"\"shared\" code."

"Now, each output file (e.g. ``homepage.js``) *may* be split into multiple"
" file (e.g. ``homepage.js``, ``vendor~homepage.js``). This means that you"
" *may* need to include *multiple* ``script`` tags (or ``link`` tags for "
"CSS) in your template. Encore creates an :ref:`entrypoints.json <encore-"
"entrypointsjson-simple-description>` file that lists exactly which CSS "
"and JavaScript files are needed for each entry."
