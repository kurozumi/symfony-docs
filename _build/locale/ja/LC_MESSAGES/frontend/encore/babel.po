"Instead of calling ``configureBabel()``, you could create a ``.babelrc`` "
"file at the root of your project. This is a more \"standard\" way of "
"configuring Babel, but it has a downside: as soon as a ``.babelrc`` file "
"is present, **Encore can no longer add any Babel configuration for you**."
" For example, if you call ``Encore.enableReactPreset()``, the ``react`` "
"preset will *not* automatically be added to Babel: you must add it "
"yourself in ``.babelrc``."
