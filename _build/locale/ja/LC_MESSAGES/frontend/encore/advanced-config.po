"Summarized, Encore generates the Webpack configuration that's used in "
"your ``webpack.config.js`` file. Encore doesn't support adding all of "
"Webpack's `configuration options`_, because many can be added on your "
"own."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:8
msgid ""
"For example, suppose you need to resolve automatically a new extension. "
"To do that, modify the config after fetching it from Encore:"

"Webpack supports passing an `array of configurations`_, which are "

"allowing to reset the state of the current configuration to build a new "
"one:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:103
msgid ""
"When running Encore, both configurations will be built in parallel. If "
"you prefer to build configs separately, pass the ``--config-name`` "

"Generating a Webpack Configuration Object without using the Command-Line "
"Interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:137
msgid ""
"Ordinarily you would use your ``webpack.config.js`` file by calling "
"Encore from the command-line interface. But sometimes, having access to "
"the generated Webpack configuration can be required by tools that don't "
"use Encore (for instance a test-runner such as `Karma`_)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:142
msgid ""
"The problem is that if you try generating that Webpack configuration "
"object without using the ``encore`` command you will encounter the "
"following error:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:149
msgid ""
"The reason behind that message is that Encore needs to know a few things "
"before being able to create a configuration object, the most important "
"one being what the target environment is."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:153
msgid ""
"To solve this issue you can use ``configureRuntimeEnvironment``. This "
"method must be called from a JavaScript file **before** requiring "
"``webpack.config.js``."

msgid "For instance:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../frontend/encore/advanced-config.rst:185
msgid ""
"This is a low-level method. All your modifications will be applied just "
"before pushing the loaders rules to Webpack. It means that you can "
