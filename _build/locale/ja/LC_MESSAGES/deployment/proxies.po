msgid "How to Configure Symfony to Work behind a Load Balancer or a Reverse Proxy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:4
msgid ""
"When you deploy your application, you may be behind a load balancer (e.g."
" an AWS Elastic Load Balancing) or a reverse proxy (e.g. Varnish for "
":doc:`caching</http_cache>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:8
msgid ""
"For the most part, this doesn't cause any problems with Symfony. But, "
"when a request passes through a proxy, certain request information is "
"sent using either the standard ``Forwarded`` header or ``X-Forwarded-*`` "
"headers. For example, instead of reading the ``REMOTE_ADDR`` header "
"(which will now be the IP address of your reverse proxy), the user's true"
" IP will be stored in a standard ``Forwarded: for=\"...\"`` header or a "
"``X-Forwarded-For`` header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:15
msgid ""
"If you don't configure Symfony to look for these headers, you'll get "
"incorrect information about the client's IP address, whether or not the "
"client is connecting via HTTPS, the client's port and the hostname being "
"requested."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:22
msgid "Solution: ``setTrustedProxies()``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:24
msgid ""
"To fix this, you need to tell Symfony which reverse proxy IP addresses to"
" trust and what headers your reverse proxy uses to send information::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:47
msgid ""
"The Request object has several ``Request::HEADER_*`` constants that "
"control exactly *which* headers from your reverse proxy are trusted. The "
"argument is a bit field, so you can also pass your own value (e.g. "
"``0b00110``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:52
msgid "But what if the IP of my Reverse Proxy Changes Constantly!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:54
msgid ""
"Some reverse proxies (like AWS Elastic Load Balancing) don't have a "
"static IP address or even a range that you can target with the CIDR "
"notation. In this case, you'll need to - *very carefully* - trust *all* "
"proxies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:58
msgid ""
"Configure your web server(s) to *not* respond to traffic from *any* "
"clients other than your load balancers. For AWS, this can be done with "
"`security groups`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:61
msgid ""
"Once you've guaranteed that traffic will only come from your trusted "
"reverse proxies, configure Symfony to *always* trust incoming request::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:76
msgid ""
"That's it! It's critical that you prevent traffic from all non-trusted "
"sources. If you allow outside traffic, they could \"spoof\" their true IP"
" address and other information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:82
msgid ""
"In applications using :ref:`Symfony Flex <symfony-flex>` you can set the "
"``TRUSTED_PROXIES`` env var:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:91
msgid ""
"If you are also using a reverse proxy on top of your load balancer (e.g. "
"`CloudFront`_), calling ``$request->server->get('REMOTE_ADDR')`` won't be"
" enough, as it will only trust the node sitting directly above your "
"application (in this case your load balancer). You also need to append "
"the IP addresses or ranges of any additional proxy (e.g. `CloudFront IP "
"ranges`_) to the array of trusted proxies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:99
msgid "Custom Headers When Using a Reverse Proxy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:101
msgid ""
"Some reverse proxies (like `CloudFront`_ with ``CloudFront-Forwarded-"
"Proto``) may force you to use a custom header. For instance you have "
"``Custom-Forwarded-Proto`` instead of ``X-Forwarded-Proto``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../deployment/proxies.rst:104
msgid ""
"In this case, you'll need to set the header ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` with "
"the value of ``Custom-Forwarded-Proto`` early enough in your application,"
" i.e. before handling the request::"
