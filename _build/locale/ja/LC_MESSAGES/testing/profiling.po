"It's highly recommended that a functional test only tests the Response. "
"But if you write functional tests that monitor your production servers, "
"you might want to write tests on the profiling data as it gives you a "
"great way to check various things and enforce some metrics."

"Collecting data with :doc:`the Symfony Profiler </profiler>` can slow "

"Setting ``collect`` to ``true`` enables the profiler for all tests. "
"However, if you need the profiler just in a few tests, you can keep it "
"disabled globally and enable the profiler individually on each test by "
"calling ``$client->enableProfiler()``."

"The data collected by the Symfony Profiler can be used to check the "
"number of database calls, the time spent in the framework, etc. All this "

"If a test fails because of profiling data (too many DB queries for "
