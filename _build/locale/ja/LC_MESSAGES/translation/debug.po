"When maintaining an application or bundle, you may add or remove "
"translation messages and forget to update the message catalogs. The "

"Suppose your application's default_locale is ``fr`` and you have "

"It shows you a table with the result when translating the message in the "
"``fr`` locale and the result when the fallback locale ``en`` would be "
"used. On top of that, it will also show you when the translation is the "
"same as the fallback translation (this could indicate that the message "
"was not correctly translated). Furthermore, it indicates that the message"
" ``Symfony is great`` is unused because it is translated, but you haven't"

"The state indicates the message is missing because it is not translated "
