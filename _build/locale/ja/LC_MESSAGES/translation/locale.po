"To set the user's locale, you may want to create a custom event listener "
"so that it's set before any other parts of the system (i.e. the "
"translator) need it::"

#: ../../../translation/locale.rst:31
msgid ""
"The custom listener must be called **before** ``LocaleListener``, which "
"initializes the locale based on the current request. To do so, set your "
"listener priority to a higher value than ``LocaleListener`` priority "
"(which you can obtain running the ``debug:event kernel.request`` "
"command)."

"Setting the locale using ``$request->setLocale()`` in the controller is "
"too late to affect the translator. Either set the locale via a listener "
"(like above), the URL (see next) or call ``setLocale()`` directly on the "
"``translator`` service."

msgid ""
"Since you can store the locale of the user in the session, it may be "
"tempting to use the same URL to display a resource in different languages"
" based on the user's locale. For example, "
"``http://www.example.com/contact`` could show content in English for one "
"user and French for another user. Unfortunately, this violates a "
"fundamental rule of the Web: that a particular URL returns the same "
"resource regardless of the user. To further muddy the problem, which "
"version of the content would be indexed by search engines?"

"A better policy is to include the locale in the URL using the "

msgid ""
"When using the special ``_locale`` parameter in a route, the matched "
"locale is *automatically set on the Request* and can be retrieved via the"
" :method:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Request::getLocale` "
"method. In other words, if a user visits the URI ``/fr/contact``, the "
"locale ``fr`` will automatically be set as the locale for the current "
"request."
