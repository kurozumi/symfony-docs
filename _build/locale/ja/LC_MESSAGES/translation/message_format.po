msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:88
msgid ""
"The curly brace syntax allows to \"modify\" the output of the variable. "
"One of these functions is the ``select`` function. It acts like PHP's "
"`switch statement`_ and allows to use different strings based on the "
"value of the variable. A typical usage of this is gender:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:135
msgid ""
"This might look very complex. The basic syntax for all functions is "
"``{variable_name, function_name, function_statement}`` (where, as you see"
" later, ``function_statement`` is optional for some functions). In this "
"case, the function name is ``select`` and its statement contains the "
"\"cases\" of this select. This function is applied over the "
"``organizer_gender`` variable::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:153
msgid ""
"The ``{...}`` syntax alternates between \"literal\" and \"code\" mode. "
"This allows you to use literal text in the select statements:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:156
msgid ""
"The first ``{organizer_gender, select, ...}`` block starts the \"code\" "
"mode, which means ``organizer_gender`` is processed as a variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:158
msgid ""
"The inner ``{... has invited you for her party!}`` block brings you back "
"in \"literal\" mode, meaning the text is not processed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:160

"Inside this block, ``{organizer_name}`` starts \"code\" mode again, "
"allowing ``organizer_name`` to be processed as variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:165
msgid ""
"While it might seem more logical to only put ``her``, ``his`` or "
"``their`` in the switch statement, it is better to use \"complex "
"arguments\" at the outermost structure of the message. The strings are in"
" this way better readable for translators and, as you can see in the "
"``other`` case, other parts of the sentence might be influenced by the "
"variables."

"Another interesting function is ``plural``. It allows you to handle "
"pluralization in your messages (e.g. ``There are 3 apples`` vs ``There is"
" one apple``). The function looks very similar to the ``select`` "
"function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../translation/message_format.rst:219
msgid ""
"Pluralization rules are actually quite complex and differ for each "
"language. For instance, Russian uses different plural forms for numbers "
"ending with 1; numbers ending with 2, 3 or 4; numbers ending with 5, 6, "
"7, 8 or 9; and even some exceptions of this!"

" function are also different for each language. For instance, Russian has"
" ``one``, ``few``, ``many`` and ``other``, while English has only ``one``"
" and ``other``. The full list of possible cases can be found in Unicode's"
" `Language Plural Rules`_ document. By prefixing with ``=``, you can "
