"In Symfony 3.x, you needed to do some extra work to make sure that your "
"cache directory was writable. But that is no longer true! In Symfony 4, "
"everything works automatically:"

"In the ``dev`` environment, ``umask()`` is used in ``bin/console`` and "
"``public/index.php`` so that any created files are writable by everyone."

"In the ``prod`` environment (i.e. when ``APP_ENV`` is ``prod`` and "
"``APP_DEBUG`` is ``0``), as long as you run ``php bin/console "
"cache:warmup``, no cache files will need to be written to disk at "
"runtime. The only exception is when using a filesystem-based cache, such "
"as Doctrine's query result cache or Symfony's cache with a filesystem "
"provider configured."

"In all environments, the log directory (``var/log/`` by default) must "
"exist and be writable by your web server user and terminal user. One way "
"this can be done is by using ``chmod -R 777 var/log/``. Be aware that "
"your logs are readable by any user on your production system."
