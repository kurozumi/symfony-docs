"In order to develop a Symfony application, you might want to use a "
"virtual development environment instead of the built-in server or "
"WAMP/LAMP. `Homestead`_ is an easy-to-use `Vagrant`_ box to get a virtual"
" environment up and running quickly."

"Due to the amount of filesystem operations in Symfony (e.g. updating "
"cache files and writing to log files), Symfony can slow down "
"significantly. To improve the speed, consider :ref:`overriding the cache "
"and log directories <override-cache-dir>` to a location outside the NFS "
"share (for instance, by using :phpfunction:`sys_get_temp_dir`). You can "
"read `this blog post`_ for more tips to speed up Symfony on Vagrant."
