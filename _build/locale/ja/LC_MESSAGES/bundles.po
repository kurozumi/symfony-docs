"In Symfony versions prior to 4.0, it was recommended to organize your own"
" application code using bundles. This is no longer recommended and "
"bundles should only be used to share code and features between multiple "
"applications."

"A bundle is similar to a plugin in other software, but even better. The "
"core features of Symfony framework are implemented with bundles "
"(FrameworkBundle, SecurityBundle, DebugBundle, etc.) They are also used "
"to add new features in your application via `third-party bundles`_."

"In a default Symfony application that uses :ref:`Symfony Flex <symfony-"

"few steps required. The new bundle is called AcmeTestBundle, where the "
"``Acme`` portion is just a dummy name that should be replaced by some "
"\"vendor\" name that represents you or your organization (e.g. "
"ABCTestBundle for some company named ``ABC``)."

"The name AcmeTestBundle follows the standard :ref:`Bundle naming "

"This empty class is the only piece you need to create the new bundle. "
