"The *best* policy is to force ``https`` on all URLs, which can be done "
"via your web server configuration or ``access_control``."

"You can force areas of your site to use the HTTPS protocol in the "
"security config. This is done through the ``access_control`` rules using "
"the ``requires_channel`` option. To enforce HTTPS on all URLs, add the "
"``requires_channel`` config to every access control:"

"To make life easier while developing, you can also use an environment "
"variable, like ``requires_channel: '%env(SECURE_SCHEME)%'``. In your "
"``.env`` file, set ``SECURE_SCHEME`` to ``http`` by default, but override"
" it to ``https`` on production."

"Forcing HTTPS while using a reverse proxy or load balancer requires a "
