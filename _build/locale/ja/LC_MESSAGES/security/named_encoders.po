"Usually, the same password encoder is used for all users by configuring "
"it to apply to all instances of a specific class:"
msgstr ""

"Another option is to use a \"named\" encoder and then select which "
"encoder you want to use dynamically."

"In the previous example, you've set the ``auto`` algorithm for "
"``App\\Entity\\User``. This may be secure enough for a regular user, but "
"what if you want your admins to have a stronger algorithm, for example "
"``auto`` with a higher cost. This can be done with named encoders:"

"If you are running PHP 7.2+ or have the `libsodium`_ extension installed,"
" then the recommended hashing algorithm to use is :ref:`Sodium "
"<reference-security-sodium>`."

"This creates an encoder named ``harsh``. In order for a ``User`` instance"
" to use it, the class must implement "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Encoder\\\\EncoderAwareInterface`."
" The interface requires one method - ``getEncoderName()`` - which should "
"return the name of the encoder to use::"

"If you created your own password encoder implementing the "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Encoder\\\\PasswordEncoderInterface`,"
" you must register a service for it in order to use it as a named "
"encoder:"
