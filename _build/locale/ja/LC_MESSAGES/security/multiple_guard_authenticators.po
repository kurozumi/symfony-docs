"The Guard authentication component allows you to use many different "

"An entry point is a service id (of one of your authenticators) whose "

"Sometimes you want to offer your users different authentication "
"mechanisms like a form login and a Facebook login while both entry points"
" redirect the user to the same login page. However, in your configuration"
" you have to explicitly say which entry point you want to use."

"However, there are use cases where you have authenticators that protect "
"different parts of your application. For example, you have a login form "
"that protects the secured area of your application front-end and API end "
"points that are protected with API tokens. As you can only configure one "
"entry point per firewall, the solution is to split the configuration into"
" two separate firewalls:"
