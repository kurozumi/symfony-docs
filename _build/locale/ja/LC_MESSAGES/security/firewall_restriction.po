msgid "How to Restrict Firewalls to a Request"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:7
msgid ""
"When using the Security component, firewalls will decide whether they "
"handle a request based on the result of a request matcher: the first "
"firewall matching the request will handle it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:11
msgid ""
"The last firewall can be configured without any matcher to handle every "
"incoming request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:15
msgid "Restricting by Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:17
msgid ""
"Most of the time you don't need to create matchers yourself as Symfony "
"can do it for you based on the firewall configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:22
msgid ""
"You can use any of the following restrictions individually or mix them "
"together to get your desired firewall configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:26
msgid "Restricting by Path"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:28
msgid ""
"This is the default restriction and restricts a firewall to only be "
"initialized if the request path matches the configured ``pattern``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:78
msgid ""
"The ``pattern`` is a regular expression. In this example, the firewall "
"will only be activated if the path starts (due to the ``^`` regex "
"character) with ``/admin``. If the path does not match this pattern, the "
"firewall will not be activated and subsequent firewalls will have the "
"opportunity to be matched for this request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:84
msgid "Restricting by Host"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:86
msgid ""
"If matching against the ``pattern`` only is not enough, the request can "
"also be matched against ``host``. When the configuration option ``host`` "
"is set, the firewall will be restricted to only initialize if the host "
"from the request matches against the configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:137
msgid ""
"The ``host`` (like the ``pattern``) is a regular expression. In this "
"example, the firewall will only be activated if the host is equal exactly"
" (due to the ``^`` and ``$`` regex characters) to the hostname "
"``admin.example.com``. If the hostname does not match this pattern, the "
"firewall will not be activated and subsequent firewalls will have the "
"opportunity to be matched for this request."

msgid "Restricting by HTTP Methods"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:147
msgid ""
"The configuration option ``methods`` restricts the initialization of the "
"firewall to the provided HTTP methods."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:197
msgid ""
"In this example, the firewall will only be activated if the HTTP method "
"of the request is either ``GET`` or ``POST``. If the method is not in the"
" array of the allowed methods, the firewall will not be activated and "
"subsequent firewalls will again have the opportunity to be matched for "
"this request."

msgid "Restricting by Service"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/firewall_restriction.rst:205

"If the above options don't fit your needs you can configure any service "
"implementing "
":class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\RequestMatcherInterface`"
