"Object properties are only validated if they are accessible, either by "

"When the object implements ``\\Traversable`` (like here with its child "
"``\\IteratorAggregate``), its traversal strategy will implicitly be set "
"and the object will be iterated over without defining the constraint. "
"It's mostly useful to add it to be explicit or to disable the traversal "
"using the ``traverse`` option. If a public getter exists to return the "
"inner books collection like ``getBooks(): Collection``, the "
":doc:`/reference/constraints/Valid` constraint can be used on the "
"``$books`` property instead."
