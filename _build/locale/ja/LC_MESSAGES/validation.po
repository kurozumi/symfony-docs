"somewhere in your application::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../validation.rst:42
msgid ""
"So far, this is just an ordinary class that serves some purpose inside "
"your application. The goal of validation is to tell you if the data of an"
" object is valid. For this to work, you'll configure a list of rules "
"(called :ref:`constraints <validation-constraints>`) that the object must"
" follow in order to be valid. These rules are usually defined using PHP "
"code or annotations but they can also be defined as ``.yaml`` or ``.xml``"
" files inside the ``config/validator/`` directory:"

"Next, to actually validate an ``Author`` object, use the ``validate()`` "

" The job of the ``validator`` is to read the constraints (i.e. rules) of "
"a class and verify if the data on the object satisfies those constraints."
" If validation fails, a non-empty list of errors "
"(:class:`Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Validator\\\\ConstraintViolationList` "
"class) is returned. Take this simple example from inside a controller::"

"Constraints can be applied to a class property (e.g. ``name``), a public "

" you to specify more complex validation rules. Finally, class constraints"

"Validating class properties is the most basic validation technique. "

"The benefit of this technique is that it allows you to validate your "
