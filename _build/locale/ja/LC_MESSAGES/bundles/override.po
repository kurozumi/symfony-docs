#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:7
msgid ""
"When using a third-party bundle, you might want to customize or override "
"some of its features. This document describes ways of overriding the most"
" common features of a bundle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:13
msgid ""
"The bundle overriding mechanism means that you cannot use physical paths "
"to refer to bundle's resources (e.g. ``__DIR__/config/services.xml``). "
"Always use logical paths in your bundles (e.g. "
"``@FooBundle/Resources/config/services.xml``) and call the "
":ref:`locateResource() method <http-kernel-resource-locator>` to turn "
"them into physical paths when needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:22
msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:24
msgid ""
"Third-party bundle templates can be overridden in the ``<your-"
"project>/templates/bundles/<bundle-name>/`` directory. The new templates "
"must use the same name and path (relative to "
"``<bundle>/Resources/views/``) as the original templates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:29
msgid ""
"For example, to override the "
"``Resources/views/Registration/confirmed.html.twig`` template from the "
"FOSUserBundle, create this template: ``<your-"
"project>/templates/bundles/FOSUserBundle/Registration/confirmed.html.twig``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:35
msgid ""
"If you add a template in a new location, you *may* need to clear your "
"cache (``php bin/console cache:clear``), even if you are in debug mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:38
msgid ""
"Instead of overriding an entire template, you may just want to override "
"one or more blocks. However, since you are overriding the template you "
"want to extend from, you would end up in an infinite loop error. The "
"solution is to use the special ``!`` prefix in the template name to tell "
"Symfony that you want to extend from the original template, not from the "
"overridden one:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:58
msgid ""
"Symfony internals use some bundles too, so you can apply the same "
"technique to override the core Symfony templates. For example, you can "
":doc:`customize error pages </controller/error_pages>` overriding "
"TwigBundle templates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:64
msgid "Routing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:66
msgid ""
"Routing is never automatically imported in Symfony. If you want to "
"include the routes from any bundle, then they must be manually imported "
"from somewhere in your application (e.g. ``config/routes.yaml``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:70
msgid ""
"The easiest way to \"override\" a bundle's routing is to never import it "
"at all. Instead of importing a third-party bundle's routing, copy that "
"routing file into your application, modify it, and import it instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:75
msgid "Controllers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:77
msgid ""
"If the controller is a service, see the next section on how to override "
"it. Otherwise, define a new route + controller with the same path "
"associated to the controller you want to override (and make sure that the"
" new route is loaded before the bundle one)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:83
msgid "Services & Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:85
msgid ""
"If you want to modify the services created by a bundle, you can use "
":doc:`service decoration </service_container/service_decoration>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:88
msgid ""
"If you want to do more advanced manipulations, like removing services "
"created by other bundles, you must work with :doc:`service definitions "
"</service_container/definitions>` inside a :doc:`compiler pass "
"</service_container/compiler_passes>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:93
msgid "Entities & Entity Mapping"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:95
msgid ""
"If a bundle defines its entity mapping in configuration files instead of "
"annotations, you can override them as any other regular bundle "
"configuration file. The only caveat is that you must override all those "
"mapping configuration files and not just the ones you actually want to "
"override."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:100
msgid ""
"If a bundle provides a mapped superclass (such as the ``User`` entity in "
"the FOSUserBundle) you can override its attributes and associations. "
"Learn more about this feature and its limitations in `the Doctrine "
"documentation`_."

msgid "Forms"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:107

"Existing form types can be modified defining :doc:`form type extensions "

msgstr ""

msgid "Validation Metadata"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:115
msgid ""
"Symfony loads all validation configuration files from every bundle and "
"combines them into one validation metadata tree. This means you are able "
"to add new constraints to a property, but you cannot override them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:119
msgid ""
"To overcome this, the 3rd party bundle needs to have configuration for "
":doc:`validation groups </validation/groups>`. For instance, the "
"FOSUserBundle has this configuration. To create your own validation, add "
"the constraints to a new validation group:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:167
msgid ""
"Now, update the FOSUserBundle configuration, so it uses your validation "
"groups instead of the original ones."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:175
msgid ""
"Translations are not related to bundles, but to translation domains. For "
"this reason, you can override any bundle translation file from the main "
"``translations/`` directory, as long as the new file uses the same "
"domain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bundles/override.rst:179
msgid ""
"For example, to override the translations defined in the "
"``Resources/translations/FOSUserBundle.es.yml`` file of the "
"FOSUserBundle, create a ``<your-"
"project>/translations/FOSUserBundle.es.yml`` file."
